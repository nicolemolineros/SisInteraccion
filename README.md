## Project Description
The original trailer for *Amelia's Child* was a suspenseful horror trailer with a dark and eerie atmosphere. To completely transform the tone, we focused on the following steps:

1. **Audio Extraction**: The audio was extracted from the trailer using a video editing tool.
2. **Sound Editing in Audacity**:
   - Adjusted the pitch and frequency of voices and sounds to create a more lighthearted and humorous tone.
   - Rearranged audio clips to change the pacing and remove ominous tones.
   - Added new sound effects that align with comedic timing and cues.
   - Eliminated or softened elements that contributed to the horror atmosphere, like deep bass rumbles or sharp, sudden noises.
3. **Reintegration of Edited Audio**: The edited audio was then synced back to the original video using iMovie. Careful attention was paid to ensure the timing remained consistent with the original trailer, so the final length matched perfectly.

## Justification
The intention behind the edits was to show how powerful audio can be in setting the mood and genre of visual media. By completely altering the soundscape, we were able to shift the perception of the trailer from a horror movie to a comedy. The decision to avoid editing the video was crucial to maintaining the integrity of the visual narrative, forcing the audio to carry the entire weight of the genre shift.
